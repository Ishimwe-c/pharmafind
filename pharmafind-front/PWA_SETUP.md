## üö® Important Notes

- Fresh pharmacy information is critical

### HTTPS Required
PWAs only work with HTTPS in production. Make sure your deployment uses SSL certificates.

### Icon Requirements
- Icons must be PNG format
- Exact sizes as specified in manifest
- Icons should be square and high quality
- Consider creating maskable icons for better Android support

## üéâ You're All Set!

Your PharmaFind app is now a fully functional PWA! Users can:
- Install it on their devices
- Access it like a native app
- Use app shortcuts for quick actions
- Enjoy a fast, app-like experience

The PWA will work great for your pharmacy finder since it provides the native app experience while always showing fresh, real-time data from your APIs.
